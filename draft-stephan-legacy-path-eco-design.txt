               legacy modularity usage for eco-conception
              draft-stephan-legacy-path-eco-design-latest

Abstract

   This draft discusses the usage of inventory information for adapting
   parts of existing device to eco-design.  It is driven by the weight
   of the manufacturing in the sustainability and resiliency cost wrt to
   the power consumption.

1.  Introduction

   Many companies in Europe have integrated sustainability improvements
   into their core business strategies.  It is driven by a growing
   awareness of environmental issues and regulatory requirements like
   CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), a regulatory
   framework proposed by the European Commission to enhance corporate
   transparency and ensure that companies provide comparable information
   to assess their sustainability performance.

   Sustainability impacts numerous aspects of the life cycle management
   (LCM) of devices.  In this draft we discuss the advantages of
   leveraging existing device modularity to increase sustainability
   performance faster.

   We first recall different uses cases where the levels of modularity
   requirements are different (Aka velodrome, shopping center ...).
   Then we present how sustainability impacts device modularity (eco
   design power management, circular economy ...) Device modularity is
   usually per design, finally we identify device modularity aspects to
   explicitly specified and standardized.

   Eco conception of new devices is not discussed in this draft.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Existing devices modularity

   There is a balance to find between the increase of the live duration
   of existing devices and their replacement with eco-design devices.
   In the mean time both are going to be included in sustainability
   approaches and they will co-exist in the networks.  In addition
   legacy devices will include more and more ecodesigned components.

   The increase of the live duration of existing devices will require
   managing the replacement not only of physical components but of any
   artifacts of the device:

   Hardware: cards and physical blocks (power ...)

   Software:

   Currently the design of always-on devices software do not include eco
   design.  Their softwares have to be prepared as their firmware can be
   adapted to reduce existing hardware power consumptions, bits rates
   ...

   Firmware:

   Currently the design of the firmware of most of devices do not
   include eco design.  Firmware must be adapted to receive components
   from eco conception.  This applies especially to the control of
   hardware parts recently designed to reduce dynamically their power
   consumptions, their bits rates or both.  This is covered by works
   like sustainality and poweff drafts.

   In summary: the work on reporting real time power efficiency is
   started.  On the other hand, there are evolutions toward more
   sustainability which require the reporting of just static information
   which must be specified.

   Examples:

   case of PoE

4.  Existing device modularity and eco design

   There are numerous definitions of eco design:

   Eco Design means that the products and services include environmental
   considerations throughout their entire lifecycle to reduce their
   environmental impact pursuant to Orange defined internal process(es),
   which are based on France’s General Reference Base for Eco-Design in
   digital services (“RGESN”) at
   https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-
   general-ecoconception/.

   Eco-design can be summarized as the concepts and current practices
   related to the integration of environmental aspects into every stage
   of a product lifecycle.  This starts at product design and
   development [ISO/TR 14062:2002 ]

   The refurbishment of existing devices with eco designed parts is part
   of LCM. datamodel pieces are needed to track these configuration
   updates.

5.  Rational for standardisation at the IETF

   modularity: info models to describe that, state, what was changed,
   what was adapted to sustainability, which part is adapted to eco
   design, on which aspect

   Does the datamodel need to say that the device is modular, how it is
   modular ?

5.1.  migration

5.2.  LCA

6.  Impact on datamodels

   trajectory of migration of legacy devices components to prepare them
   to eco design :

   which parts, which order : firmware, software, hardware (power block)

   TODO add link to sust draft and inventory draft

7.  Security Considerations

   The tracking of LCM information may reveal information on the owner
   of the device

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
