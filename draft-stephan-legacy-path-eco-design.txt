1.  Introduction

   Many companies in Europe have integrated sustainability improvements
   into their core business strategies.  It is driven by a growing
   awareness of environmental issues and regulatory requirements like
   CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), a regulatory
   framework proposed by the European Commission to enhance corporate
   transparency and ensure that companies provide comparable information
   to assess their sustainability performance.

   Sustainability impacts numerous aspects of the life cycle management
   (LCM) of devices.  In this draft we discuss the advantages of
   leveraging existing device modularity to increase sustainability
   performance faster.

   We first recall different uses cases where the levels of modularity
   requirements are different (Aka velodrome, shopping center ...).
   Then we present how sustainability impacts device modularity (eco
   design power management, circular economy ...) Device modularity is
   usually per design, finally we identify device modularity aspects to
   explicitly specified and standardized.

   Eco conception of new devices is not discussed in this draft.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Existing devices modularity

   There is a balance to find between the increase of the live duration
   of existing devices and their replacement with eco design devices.

   Eco design modularity applies not only to physical components but to
   any artifacts of the device:

   Hardware : cards and physical blocks (power ...)

4.  Security Considerations

   The tracking of LCM information may reveal information on the owner
   of the device

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
