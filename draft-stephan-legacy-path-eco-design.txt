               legacy modularity usage for eco-conception
              draft-stephan-legacy-path-eco-design-latest

Abstract

   This draft discusses the usage of inventory information for adapting
   parts of existing devices to eco-design.  It is driven by the weight
   of the manufacturing in the sustainability and resiliency cost wrt to
   the power consumption.

1.  Introduction

   Many companies in Europe have integrated sustainability improvements
   into their core business strategies.  It is driven by a growing
   awareness of environmental issues and regulatory requirements like
   CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), a regulatory
   framework proposed by the European Commission to enhance corporate
   transparency and ensure that companies provide comparable information
   to assess their sustainability performance.

   Sustainability impacts numerous aspects of the life cycle management
   (LCM) of devices.  In this draft we discuss the advantages of
   leveraging existing device modularity to introduce eco-designed
   components in the networks.

   The rational is the urgent need to start decreasing resource
   consumption using simple components replacements.  It can be view as
   a very basic first deployment of GREEN-bof approach as it enables the
   life comparison of the power consumption of legacy line cards with
   eco-designed line cards.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Network and devices modularity

   Networks and theirs devices are modular per design to cope with
   manufacturing and operationnal obvious constraints.  Existing devices
   are going to be progressively replaced with eco-design products.
   Both will co-exist in the networks.  There is a balance to find
   between the increase of the live duration of existing devices and
   their replacement with eco-design devices [SUSTINS].

   The same approach will applies at the same time to each individual
   devices: legacy devices will include progressively more and more
   ecodesigned components.

   Hardware components update can be separate in 2 categories: *
   "Stateless gain" update : 'Just' consume significally less power when
   running and required less ressources during manufacturing and
   deployment

   *  "Controled gain" update: dynamic power consumption actionable
      using device software components

4.  Stateless Gain

4.1.  LCA

   Eco Design means that the products and services include environmental
   considerations throughout their entire lifecycle to reduce their
   environmental impact pursuant to Orange defined internal process(es),
   which are based on France’s General Reference Base for Eco-Design in
   digital services (“RGESN”) at
   https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-
   general-ecoconception/.

   Eco-design can be summarized as the concepts and current practices
   related to the integration of environmental aspects into every stage
   of a product lifecycle.  This starts at product design and
   development [ISO/TR 14062:2002 ]

   The refurbishment of existing devices with eco designed parts is part
   of LCM. datamodel pieces are needed to track these configuration
   updates.

4.2.  Impact on datamodels

   modularity: info models to describe that, state, what was changed,
   what was adapted to sustainability, which part is adapted to eco
   design, on which aspect

   Does the datamodel need to say that the device modularity has changed
   ? An example is the chnage of a power block to a modular power block

   Measurement of the gain.

5.  Controled Gain

   The increase of the live duration of existing devices will require
   managing the replacement of software and firmware components of the
   devices:

   Currently the design of design of the software components ofalways-on
   devices do not include, or very recently include, eco design.  Their
   softwares have to be prepared as their firmware can be adapted to
   reduce existing hardware power consumptions, bits rates ...

   Firmware:

   Currently the design of the firmware of most of devices do not
   include eco design.  Firmware must be adapted to receive components
   from eco conception.  This applies especially to the control of
   hardware parts recently designed to reduce dynamically their power
   consumptions, their bits rates or both.  This is covered by works
   like sustainality and poweff drafts.

   In summary: the work on reporting real time power efficiency is
   started.  On the other hand, there are evolutions toward more
   sustainability which require the reporting of just static information
   which must be specified.

6.  Gain measurements

   There is room for hackathon sessions to compare testing measurements
   of the gains in power consumption. this may include the power
   consumption of the testing solutions

7.  Security Considerations

   The tracking of LCM information may reveal to third parties
   information of the device usages.

   Dynamically controled power may introduce weakeness in networking
   performance and resiliency.

8.  IANA Considerations

   At this step this document has no IANA actions.
