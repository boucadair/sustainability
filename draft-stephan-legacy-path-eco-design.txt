               legacy modularity usage for eco-conception
              draft-stephan-legacy-path-eco-design-latest

Abstract

   This draft discusses the usage of inventory information for assessing
   the adaptation of existing devices to eco-design.  It is driven by
   the weight of the manufacturing in the sustainability cost with
   regard to the power consumption.

1.  Introduction

   Many companies in Europe have integrated sustainability improvements
   into their core business strategies.  It is driven by a growing
   awareness of environmental issues and regulatory requirements like
   CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), a regulatory
   framework proposed by the European Commission to enhance corporate
   transparency and ensure that companies provide comparable information
   to assess their sustainability performance.

   Sustainability impacts numerous aspects of the life cycle management
   (LCM) of devices.  In this draft we discuss the advantages of
   leveraging existing devices modularity to introduce eco-designed
   components in the networks while being able to assess the gains in
   sustainability.

   The rational is the urgent need to start decreasing resource
   consumption by simply replacing devices components.  It can be view
   as a very basic use case of GREEN-bof [GREEN-BOF] approach which
   enable the comparison of power consumption of legacy line cards with
   eco-designed line cards.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Network and devices modularity

   Networks and theirs devices are modular per design to cope with
   manufacturing and operationnal obvious constraints.  Existing devices
   are going to be progressively replaced with eco-design products.
   Both will co-exist in the networks as there is a balance to find
   between the increase of the live duration of existing devices and
   their replacement with eco-design devices [SUSTINS].

   The same approach will apply at the same time to individual devices:
   legacy devices will include progressively more and more eco-designed
   hardware ans sofware components.

   Eco Design means that the products and services include environmental
   considerations throughout their entire lifecycle to reduce their
   environmental impact.  In France they are based on General Reference
   Base for Eco-Design in digital services (“RGESN”) at
   https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-
   general-ecoconception/.

   Eco-design can be summarized as the concepts and current practices
   related to the integration of environmental aspects into every stage
   of a product lifecycle.  This starts at product design and
   development [ISO/TR 14062:2002 ]

   The upgrade of legacy devices with eco-designed components can be
   separate in 2 categories:

   *  "Simple" update : The adaptation is simple, a card is 'just'
      replaced with another one which consumes significally less power
      by itself when running and which required less ressources during
      its manufacturing and its deployment.

   *  "Complex" update: The replacement of the component requires the
      adding or the update of software components to enable dynamic
      power consumption.

4.  Simple Update

   Network operators update their device since decades.Such deployment
   can started immediatly as there is no dependency on management
   solutions.  In addition assessement of environmental and power gains
   can be done manually from the datasheets of the manufacturer.

   Nevertheless, in a way to scale, inventory requires to distinguish
   legacy devices which include eco-designed components and these
   components inside the device.

5.  Complex Update

   The increase of the live duration of existing devices will require
   managing the replacement of software and firmware components of the
   devices:

   Currently the design of the software components of networks always-on
   devices do not include, or very recently include, dynamic power
   management.  The replacement of adding of software Their software
   components must be added as their firmwares support reducing
   dynamically hardware power consumptions, bits rates...

   The refurbishment of existing devices with eco-designed components is
   part of LCM.  Its assessement at the device level requires some
   datamodel adaptation to track these configuration updates and metrics
   to measure the power consumption.

6.  Gain measurements

   There is room for hackathon sessions to compare testing measurements
   of the gains in power consumption.  It applies separatly to any
   hardware and sofware components

7.  Security Considerations

   The tracking of LCM information may reveal to third parties
   information of the device usages.

8.  IANA Considerations

   At this step this document has no IANA actions.
